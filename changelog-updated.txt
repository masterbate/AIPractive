NOTE - PANDA3D 1.8 IS THE BUGGIEST PIECE OF SHIT I'VE EVER SEEN.
*joshsora downgrades to panda3D 1.7.2* :D everything works again :D

Bugs:
- Camera floating (easily fixable)
- Tunnel floating (easily fixable)
- wallCollisions no longer work (panda3D 1.8.1 Bug?)
  Solution : the nodes need to be replaced. (easily fixable)
